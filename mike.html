    <h1>About Mike</h1>

	  <p>Hi, I&#8217;m Mike Gore. I&#8217;m a Master&#8217;s student in computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder and will be graduating in May 2017. Last year, I spent a semester at the Technische Universit&auml;t Darmstadt in Germany.</p>

	  <p>I enjoy reading, writing, basketball, and American football. (Go Broncos!)</p>
	
	  <p>I love computers, especially software. I don't understand why there are Mac people, Windows people, or even Linux people, when they&#8217;re all awesome and worth getting to know.</p>
